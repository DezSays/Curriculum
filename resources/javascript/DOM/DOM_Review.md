## Introduction to the DOM (Document Object Model)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a tree that represents the structure of a web page. Imagine the web page as a tree with branches and leaves. Each branch and leaf corresponds to an element on the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and more. These elements are called nodes in the DOM tree.

At the top of the tree is the document node, which represents the entire web page, just like the main trunk of the tree. The document node is the starting point that allows us to access and modify the content of the entire page.

As we move down the tree, each branch further divides into smaller branches and leaves. Similarly, in the DOM, each parent node can have child nodes, forming a hierarchical structure.

With the DOM, we can interact with the web page and manipulate its content. For example, we can find specific elements on the web page by navigating through the branches and leaves of the DOM tree using their unique tags, IDs, or classes.

Once we locate an element, we can change its content, such as updating the text or modifying its attributes. Additionally, we can create new elements and add them to the DOM tree, just like adding new branches and leaves to the tree.

By using the DOM, we gain control over the structure and content of the web page. It empowers us to create interactive features, update the page based on user actions, and make the web page more dynamic and engaging.

In summary, the DOM is like a tree representation of a web page that allows us to navigate, access, and modify its content. It enables us to interact with elements, change their content, add new elements, and ultimately create dynamic and interactive web experiences.

### Accessing Elements in the DOM

1. Accessing elements by ID: Each element on a web page can have a unique ID attribute. We can select an element by its ID using the `getElementById()` method. It's like finding a specific room in a house by its unique room number.

Example:
```javascript
const myDiv = document.getElementById("myDiv");
```

2. Accessing elements by tag name: We can select multiple elements that share the same tag name using the `getElementsByTagName()` method. It's like finding all the rooms of a specific type in a house.

Example:
```javascript
const paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
```

3. Accessing elements by class name: We can select multiple elements that have the same class name using the `getElementsByClassName()` method. It's like finding all the rooms with a specific purpose in a house.

Example:
```javascript
const myElements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
```

By selecting elements using these methods, we can store them in variables and perform further operations on them.

**Practice Exercise 1: Selecting Elements**

Instructions:
1. Select an element with the ID "myDiv" and store it in a variable called `myDiv`.
2. Select all `<p>` elements on the page and store them in a variable called `paragraphs`.
3. Select all elements with the class "myClass" and store them in a variable called `myElements`.

## Manipulating the DOM

4. Changing element content: We can modify the content of an element by changing its text or HTML. To change the text content of an element, we can use the `textContent` property. It's like changing the text written on a signboard. To change the HTML content of an element, we can use the `innerHTML` property. It's like replacing the contents of a room with new furniture.

Example: Changing the text content of an element
```javascript
myDiv.textContent = "New text content";
```

Example: Changing the HTML content of an element
```javascript
myDiv.innerHTML = "<strong>New HTML content</strong>";
```

5. Creating and appending elements: We can create new elements using the `createElement()` method and add them to existing elements in the DOM using the `appendChild()` method. It's like adding new furniture to a room.

Example:
```javascript
const newParagraph = document.createElement("p");
newParagraph.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";

myDiv.appendChild(newParagraph);
```

In this example, we create a new `<p>` element, set its text content, and append it to the `myDiv` element.

**Practice Exercise 2: Modifying the DOM**

Instructions:
1. Select the element with the ID "myDiv" and store it in a

 variable called `myDiv`.
2. Change the text content of `myDiv` to "New content".
3. Create a new `<p>` element, set its text content to "This is a new paragraph," and append it to `myDiv`.

## Traversing the DOM

6. Accessing parent elements: We can access the parent element of a node using the `parentNode` property. It's like finding the room that contains a specific item.

Example:
```javascript
const parentElement = myElement.parentNode;
```

7. Accessing child elements: We can access the child elements of a node using the `childNodes` property or other methods like `children` or `querySelectorAll()`. It's like exploring the different items present in a room.

Example using `childNodes`:
```javascript
const children = parentElement.childNodes;
```

Example using `children`:
```javascript
const children = parentElement.children;
```

Example using `querySelectorAll()`:
```javascript
const children = parentElement.querySelectorAll("p");
```

8. Accessing siblings: We can access the sibling elements of a node using the `previousSibling` and `nextSibling` properties. It's like moving to the adjacent rooms.

Example:
```javascript
const previousSibling = myElement.previousSibling;
const nextSibling = myElement.nextSibling;
```

By traversing the DOM, we can navigate through the elements and perform actions based on their relationships.

**Practice Exercise 3: Traversing the DOM**

Instructions:
1. Select an element with the ID "myElement" and store it in a variable called `myElement`.
2. Access the parent element of `myElement` and store it in a variable called `parentElement`.
3. Access the child elements of `parentElement` and store them in a variable called `children`.
4. Access the previous and next sibling elements of `myElement` and store them in variables called `previousSibling` and `nextSibling`, respectively.

## Manipulating CSS Classes

9. Adding and removing CSS classes: We can add a CSS class to an element using the `classList.add()` method and remove a CSS class using the `classList.remove()` method. It's like changing the style of a room by adding or removing decorations.

Example: Adding a class to an element
```javascript
myElement.classList.add("highlight");
```

Example: Removing a class from an element
```javascript
myElement.classList.remove("inactive");
```

10. Toggling CSS classes: We can toggle a CSS class on an element using the `classList.toggle()` method. If the class is already present, it will be removed. If it's not present, it will be added. It's like switching between different styles of an outfit.

Example: Toggling a class on an element
```javascript
myElement.classList.toggle("active");
```

**Practice Exercise 4: Manipulating CSS Classes**

Instructions:
1. Select an element with the ID "myElement" and store it in a variable called `myElement`.
2. Add the class "highlight" to `myElement`.
3. Remove the class "inactive" from `myElement`.
4. Toggle the class "active" on `myElement`.

## Handling Form Input

12. Handling Form Input: Forms are used to collect information from users, like their name or email address. We can access and update the values entered in form inputs using JavaScript.
13. Accessing form elements: We can select form elements using their IDs or other selection methods. It's like identifying the fields on a form by their labels.
14. Retrieving and changing input values: We can get the value entered in an input element using the `value` property. It's like

 reading the information filled in a form field. We can also set a new value using the same property.

Example: Retrieving the value of an input field
```javascript
const nameInput = document.getElementById("nameInput");
const name = nameInput.value;
```

Example: Setting a new value for an input field
```javascript
const emailInput = document.getElementById("emailInput");
emailInput.value = "example@example.com";
```

By accessing and manipulating form inputs, we can build interactive web forms that respond to user actions.

**Practice Exercise 5: Handling Form Input**

Instructions:
1. Select the input element with the ID "nameInput" and store it in a variable called `nameInput`.
2. Retrieve the value entered in `nameInput` and store it in a variable called `name`.
3. Select the input element with the ID "emailInput" and store it in a variable called `emailInput`.
4. Set the value of `emailInput` to "example@example.com".
